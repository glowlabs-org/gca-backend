# GCA Backend

This repository contains all of the code related to running the GCA servers,
and the clients that report to the servers,

## Standards and Conventions

Within the code, "PublicKey" can be abbreviated to "PubKey" or "pubKey", but
not "pubkey". Same convention goes for "PrivateKey" - "PrivKey" and "privKey"
are okay but "privkey" is not.

Filenames use camelCase and any non-standard filetype ends with the extention
'.dat'. For example, filenames can be 'gcaPubKey.dat' or 'history.dat'

Units:
	+ 3 decimals of precision for latitude and longitude
	+ MilliWatt hours is the base unit of precision for energy
	+ Milliwatts is the base unit of precision for power
	+ Grams is the base unit of precision for emissions
	+ Grams per megawatt hour is the base unit of precision for emission rates
	+ Timeslots (5 minutes) is the base unit of precision for protocol time
	+ Seconds is the base unit of precision for clock time

Always use LittleEndian when encoding numbers to binary.

Anything that needs to be signed should have an explicit 'SigningBytes()'
function.
