package server

// This file creates an API endpoint that monitoring equipment can hit over
// UDP. The purpose of the provided API is to collect reports from the
// monitoring equipment. UDP is used as the protocol because it is the most
// lightweight, and reports are going to be sent over IoT networks, which means
// that they need to be very light.
//
// Reports will *always* be just one packet, so we don't have to worry about
// packet fragmentation when rebuilding the UDP stream. We do have to worry
// about dropped packets, this is handled by a separate TCP endpoint that
// communicates to the IoT device which reports have been received vs not
// received for the equipment. The equipment can then resend anything that
// didn't successfully transfer across the network.
//
// This combination should keep long term bandwidth requirements low while
// still preserving long term reliability.
